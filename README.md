# Diary

## Introduction

I gather technical knowledge from a wide variety of sources. I have always struggled to keep track on it. I had multiple notes, systems, and places for storing it.

This repository is meant to collect all the knowledge that I find important to my professional growth. Its structure will probably change over the time. 

The notes might me chaotic. They're not meant to be perfect. They're meant to leave a mark that I spot something interesting and found it valuable.
