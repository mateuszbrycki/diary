# Diary

## Introduction

I gather technical knowledge from a wide variety of sources. I have always struggled to keep track of it. I had multiple notes, systems, and places for storing it.

This repository is meant to collect all the knowledge that I find important to my professional growth. Its structure will probably change over time. 

The notes might be chaotic. They're not meant to be perfect. They're meant to leave a mark that I spot something interesting and find it valuable. 

Any content written by AI will be appropriately marked.
