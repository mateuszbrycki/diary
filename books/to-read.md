# To Read

A list of books to read with an explanation of why I found them interesting.

1. [Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html)

    **Author:** M. Fowler

    **Why:** the book describes how to design code and unit tests so that the tests are resilient to implementation changes ([source](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/451090)).

    **Tags:** testing, software architecture

2.  [Enterprise Patterns and MDA: Building Better Software with Archetype Patterns and UML](https://www.amazon.pl/Enterprise-Patterns-MDA-Building-Archetype/dp/032111230X)

    **Author:** J. Arlow and I. Neustadt
    
    **Why:** the book provides examples and details of various software archetypes common within enterprise systems. Knowledge about the archetypes helps discover proper implementations for deep domain models quicker.

    **Tags:** software architecture, software archetypes

3.  [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://mimoza.marmara.edu.tr/~msakalli/cse706_12/SkienaTheAlgorithmDesignManual.pdf)

    **Author:** S. Skiena
    
    **Why:** the book provides descriptions of the most common algorithms. Knowledge about algorithms helps in abstracting specific problems and finding generic solutions. The book's table of contents is composed in a way that helps to find an algorithm that solves your problem.

    **Tags:** software archetypes, algorithms
