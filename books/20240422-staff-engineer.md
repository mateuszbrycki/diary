# Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track

**Author:** Will Larson

## Notes

### Senior vs Staff Engineer

A staff engineer isn’t just a faster senior engineer. Transitioning from Senior to Staff is like “solving somewhat clear-cut problems to being responsible for finding the right problems and then figuring out how to convince people that it’s important to solve them”.
Staff role is a very different job than being a senior engineer. You’ll find yourself doing work that you previously did infrequently or not-at-all. Much of the work has a much slower feedback loop.

### Being Staff Engineer
Staff engineers set technical direction by providing sponsorship and mentorship, injecting engineering context into organizational decisions. The tasks they used to do as senior engineers are now their auxiliary tasks.

Successful staff engineers preach about companies’ technology. They focus on the long-term trend of progress. They don’t view individual decisions as a make-or-break crisis. They’re part-time product managers for technology. 

They're the glue that keeps the team moving forward. Sometimes they are invisible while doing the most important work behind the scenes. 
There is almost always a lot of work that no one wants to do or is not paying attention to. You’ll be making rapid initial progress on it. Usually, you will need support in the later stages. You will need to start advocating for investing in that part of the organization. 
Focus on work that matters, do projects that develop you, and steer towards companies that value genuine experience. 

A big component of being successful as a Staff-plus engineer is being able to identify and scope net-new impactful work and to convince others of its value and impact. Communication and building narratives are key. You’re always going to be your advocate. 
The most effective leaders spend more time following than leading. Staff Engineers are leaders who navigate the teams. To get buy-in for their projects, they need to be trustworthy and easy to be around.

### Remote Staff Engineer
They need to be very deliberate about building connections up and down the chain of command. They must advocate for their project to help them get traction. In mature companies being remote should not affect being promoted to a Staff-plus role.
