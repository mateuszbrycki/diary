# Career Stoppers

## Personal skills
### No career planning
You change jobs or companies when something bad happens—the project is going in the wrong direction, or you experience burnout. 

There is no planning before. People just consider pay grade.
YOLO Development. 

Exercise:
1. Analyze your career - what lead you to the actual place? What skills decided about your promotion? Why do you receive better job offers? What do you give out to your team? **Do it at least once a year.**
1. What blocks you? What skills from a higher position do you lack? What should you improve to get there? Tip: Build a list of dream companies and find positions that you wouldn’t get now. Build a list of skills required for these roles and work on them. You can also analyze profiles of the people already occupying these positions. What projects did they work on? Build a plan for the next 12-24 months. Set one goal per quarter. Make them SMART.

### Burnout Management
We don’t understand why we burn out.

Analyze your TOP5 Gallup Strengths. These things both prevent burnout (underuse) and LEAD to burnout (overuse).

The more responsibility you have, the bigger the effect of your burnout. 

### Change Resistance
Change is the only constant. We need to adopt. There are new technologies, new WoW. You need to be ready for fundamental changes.

Your technology is not the only way of doing things. The world is changing. 

Work on your craftsmanship. Our job is about learning and humility. We need to improve the way we learn. 

The lack of flexibility might block your career growth.

"Why our tomorrow’s decisions make sense?"
Pain + reflection = progress

## Interpersonal skills
### Poor Communication & Sales
We’re mainly introverts. We don’t feel comfortable communicating. 

The lack of effective communication leads to many problems in teams or between teams.

Ideas for activities:
1. Presentations
1. Workshops
1. Mentoring

The meeting facilitation school. Teaches communication and effective goal accomplishment. Teaches empathy. Helps you manage meetings, discussions, or brainstorming.

You sell all the time. Anytime you want to convince your team to your solution, you sell.

### Personal brand / Networking

Personal brand - our sign, our name. Do we build it consciously? 

Personal brand is not only social media. It’s with us when working in the team, in the company. 

Promote yourself either internally or externally. Define your brand and work on it.

Tip:
1. Define Unique Value Proposition - where do you stand out? What are your super skills?
2. Build consistent communication around yourself - SM profiles, the way you present slides/knowledge.
3. Build the expert knowledge and present it to the other people. Use blogs, newsletters, conferences 
4. Build a network around your expert knowledge. 
5. Dismantle the public profile of a person from IT you admire. What are his signs? How does he communicate?

## Product skills
### Lack of ownership
How often do you don’t take ownership? “I’m
just a software developer” 

Software development is craftsmanship. It’s not only about completing JIRA tasks. It’s not about technical problems. 

We should solve and understand business problems. Development is 10% of the whole process.

We make wrong decisions when we don’t understand the business context. Strategic DDD for the rescue. 

We don’t understand software development
Any company nowadays is a technological business. We build the software. We are in the hearth of the business. 

People use our solutions. We use the solutions of different people.

We’re responsible for the way the world operates now.
